# Askfm

This is my first OOP project with c++.It is a simple simulationof ASKfm app.
## I used:
- classes & objects
- structures
- Inherutance
- files
## How to use project:
- first sign in if you have an account or sign up if you don't

- Then a Menu will be shown you can do one of them:
    - 1- View questions forwarded to you
    - 2- View questions you asked
    - 3- Ask a questions
    - 4- Answer a question
    - 5- Delete question
    - 6- List all the users in the system
    - 7- See all questions and answers
    - 8- Log out
